# Placeholder for 3D Card Model

This directory should contain:
- card.glb: A 3D model of a card/badge (GLTF binary format)
- lanyard.png: A texture image for the lanyard string

## How to add your own 3D assets:

1. Export or create a card model in Blender or any 3D software
2. Export as GLB format
3. Place the card.glb file in this directory
4. Add a lanyard.png texture image for the string

For now, the component will work without these files by using basic Three.js geometry as fallback.
